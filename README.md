# MSc Analysis of Student Exam Scores in Python

My first analysis in Python as a MSc student! Our task was to critically assess, select, and apply data science tools. I chose data on exam results from a school in the USA including categorical variables like race, exam preparation, parental level of education, and whether they qualified for free school meals. 
I thought it would be interesting to see what correlations there might be between exam performance and some of these categorical variables by using data visualisation 
libraries. I was particularly interested in parental level of education and its relationship to a young person's exam performance due to my own personal life experience 
both while at school myself and more recently as a secondary school Governor.
